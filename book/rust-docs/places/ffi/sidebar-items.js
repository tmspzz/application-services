So our .udl defines a single error type - ErrorWrapper::Wrapped(). The `String` message there is, roughly, `format!(\"{}|{}\", extern_error.code, extern_error.message)`. There then exists code on the Swift and Kotlin side of the world which unpacks this and returns the exact same error objects as if it was an `ExternError` in the first place."]],"mod":[["error_codes",""]],"struct":[["APIS",""],["CONNECTIONS",""],["Dummy",""],["FfiConverterTypeDocumentType",""],["FfiConverterTypeDummy",""],["FfiConverterTypeErrorWrapper",""],["FfiConverterTypeHistoryHighlight",""],["FfiConverterTypeHistoryHighlightWeights",""],["FfiConverterTypeHistoryMetadata",""],["FfiConverterTypeHistoryMetadataObservation",""]]});
